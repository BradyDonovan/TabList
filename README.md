# TabList
A Firefox extension to get a list of your tabs at the click of a button.

# Installing
Follow the instructions **[here](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/)** to install this extension.

Note: I have no plans to formally sign and publish this extension. The instructions linked above are for developers to install extensions for debugging / testing. This means there will be no one-click option to install it via the Firefox Extension store; it must be done manually.
